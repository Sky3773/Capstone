        <h3>Links to Third Party Websites</h3>
            <p>
            The 77Library website has links to external sites that it does not control and has no relationship to. 
            Some of those sites, such as Facebook, are notorious wholesale collectors of private data, 
            and it has been reported that such data are freely shared with national spy organizations and others. 
            We strive to link in a manner that does not allow those third party websites to see what you are doing on 77Library unless 
            you explicitly select one of those links. When you select a third party link, you will leave the 77Library website, 
            and we cannot tell you what the other site will do with your data.
